## Inconvenient providence 

Leslie, 

I hope that this note finds you well and in good comfort. I really don't know if you will ever get this message. Even if by chance you do, you might not read it. You might simply roll your eyes, and pitch this in the trash. But if ever you do, know that I one time I loved you, and although we have ceased to exist together in that period of time. There will always be a part of me, that will always love you in that place and time. There will always be a part of my soul there. We both have left that place there and cannot return to it due to the linear nature of time. . I never knew if you knew how much I cared. But, at this moment it is those memories that I forged with you, that keep me alive. 

You see I had flown into town to collect my last remaining belonging, my car, but the body shop had not fixed it when I arrived. Also, my buddy whom I was crashing with, forgot to tell his significant mormon other that I would be using the couch for a two or three days. When she found out, she was less than pleased. Visibily so... It was apparent that in order to save his temple sanctified home life, I had to head out and pitch my tent on new grounds. I couldn't leave due to my flight arrangements, and I didn't know where else to go. So, I started to drive around the state of utah, to see another side to the state I once called home. 

On my travels Utah gave away to Idaho, and quickly gave away to the glorious state of Montana. I had never seen such a beautiful place. Lost in the beauty of the northern rockys. I wandered to the reported most beautiful place in america, Glacier National Park. The beauty of the area filled my heart with warmth and hope. I had forgotten where I was, and being a southern farmer in a Northwestern state does not help the situation either. I was not acustomed to how quickly things can go from cozy to freezing. 

I had begun to set my tent and prepare for what I had assumed to be a warm night. But, after dark fell, the temperature plummeted. I didn't even have a coat to put on. Fortunately, I discovered an old shirt of mine, had been stuffed in the emergency kit in the back.
