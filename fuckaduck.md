### Intro

<p>Like most sunday mornings attempting to recooperate from Saturday's chenanigans. Cole, stood at the corner of his bed and stared at the floor. Although, he was in a happy new place, he felt a inner emptiness. </p> 
He felt alone.

He hadn't really been in town long enough to make solid friends. He was still the new kid, or even worse...outsider. 

Sundays were they days that he felt this the most. Being a non-member in happy valley, which was and still is the most heavily and densly mormon populated areas in the world. Everyone else in the valley went through their sunday ritual of church and then home for leisure. 
For those that were not adjusted or caring for the lifestyle, it was difficult to fight the trend. The valley became a virtual ghost town on sundays. The streets, any other day of the week would be gridlocked. But on sundays, this was an entirely different story. The majority of stores and restraunts are closed in utah valley on sundays. This includes gas stations, which can leave a forgetful traveler stranded and at the mercy of a passing mormon. 
. 
The best way cole had to survive the barren sunday landscapes, was to get out of the valley, and back around normal folk. 
Before he knew it, he had jumped in his car, ... One block,... Then two blocks, next the ramp to the interstate. 
I-15 Stood as a gigantic concrete megalith, that would carry cole back to life. It stark grey colossal body layed across the floor of the valley like a sleeping monster. Cole reved the engine and zoomed off to the city. 
<hr>
Downtown was hopping on a sunday afternoon, it was the only viable option. Seeing nothing through much of downtown, but the mormon temple, which was still open for business as usual. Cole caught a glimpse of the local Utah Jazz collesium. Which looked like it was open. A parking place quickly appeared, and it looked like prime pickings. 

In life if your not sure where to go, just watch the crowds, in general humans are just like cows, we herd together.
