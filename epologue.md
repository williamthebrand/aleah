Lessons from alaina

I think after all this time, I have come to understand what it is to love another. But before I continue, it goes without saying that there are just some words that surpass language , and love is one of those. let us start with what love is not:

It is not necessarily how pretty the she is, or
how big her this or that body part is, or
her money/income, or
how she dresses, or
how hot she makes you feel, or
her awesome high paying job, or
her political on social influence, or
even how she makes you feel inside.

But what matters is who that person truly and deeply is inside. It is how through time, hen experiences and her choices, life has formed a pata Also love is understanding that like you, they are human too and are locked in the same eternal struggle as the rest of us.

I remembered the conversation I had with my best friend, phillip. I told him about her, and how the situation stunk. He got pretty angry at me, looked at me square in the face and asked, did you sleep with her? did you kiss her? I erupted at him, "It was nothing like that at all, nothing physical. I just want my best friend back!"

The eruption proved enough for the both of us. That somehow this was different.

Although she is long gone, and that person has ceased to exist, because that time in our life is over and we cannot go back. I have come to understand, that really remembering her as she was. She would not want me, to be living like this. She would truly want me to be assurred in myself, that it was not whether or not I was good enough. She was constantly forcing me to believe in myself, and not doubt my own character. She wanted me to be much more confident in myself, because it was that confident person inside me that she loved the most. She believed in me deeply, and urged me to do the same.

So, after all these years, the best way that I know to honor her, is to believe and never doubt myself or my thoughts again. This is what she would want of me to do.
