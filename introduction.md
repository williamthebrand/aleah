## Inconvenient providence 

Leslie, 

I hope that this note finds you well and in good comfort. I really don't know if you will ever get this message. Even if by chance you do, you might not read it. You might simply roll your eyes, and pitch this in the trash. But if ever you do, know that I one time I loved you, and although we have ceased to exist together in that period of time. There will always be a part of me, that will always love you in that place and time. There will always be a part of my soul there. We both have left that place there and cannot return to it due to the linear nature of time. . I never knew if you knew how much I cared. But, at this moment it is those memories that I forged with you, that keep me alive. 

You see I had flown into town to collect my last remaining belonging, my car, but the body shop had not fixed it when I arrived. Also, my buddy whom I was crashing with, forgot to tell his significant mormon other that I would be using the couch for a two or three days. When she found out, she was less than pleased. Visibily so... It was apparent that in order to save his temple sanctified home life, I had to head out and pitch my tent on new grounds. I couldn't leave due to my flight arrangements, and I didn't know where else to go. So, I started to drive around the state of utah, to see another side to the state I once called home. 

On my travels Utah gave away to Idaho, and quickly gave away to the glorious state of Montana. I had never seen such a beautiful place. Lost in the beauty of the northern rockys. I wandered to the reported most beautiful place in america, Glacier National Park. The beauty of the area filled my heart with warmth and hope. I had forgotten where I was, and being a southern farmer in a Northwestern state does not help the situation either. I was not acustomed to how quickly things can go from cozy to freezing, I had also discovered how untimid some of the local wildlife is. 

I had begun to set my tent and prepare for what I had assumed to be a warm night. But, it ripped as lifted it out of the trunk. I started to pictch it anyway, but out of no where a male mule deer appeared. He was trying to run me off from his territory. He was snorting and stomping the ground with his feet. Scared and nervous about my new site observer, I sliced my finger on the trunk of the car. Now I had a critical situation on my hands. The local hospital where I could recieve medical attention was over two hours away in the indian reservation. 

Confused and frustrated I tried to get the wound to stop bleeding and had no luck. All I could do is wrap the wounded member in a hankerchief and seek some help in the morning somehow. 

After dark fell, things went from bad to worse, the temperature plummeted. I had no way to shelter my body from the cold. I had forgotten to grab my camping gear, but I discovered an emergency blanket in the first aid kit in the back of the car. I still do not know what those things are designed to do, but surely it failed at keeping my body warm. 

I laid that night awake, in the front of my car. Dreaming of the life that I had in the past, dreaming of you. I remember feeling the numb cold take grasp of my body, and this over whelming sense of exhaustion pull me to sleep. the sounds of the empty wilderness surrounded me as the ice crystals began to form on the windshield of my car. 

It was at that moment, I started to lose faith. I had never really been so unprepared before and found compromised of my safety and health. I had also never felt such great cold before. 

But out of all the cold and numbness, I held onto the most beautiful thought. I held onto that thought go give me the strength and allow ner toi aty myself through.
